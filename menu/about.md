### In short
My name is Alejandra Gonzalez and Iâ€™m a PhD student from Mexico at the Institute of Theoretical Physics (TPI), University of Jena in Germany, under the supervision of [Prof. Sebastiano Bernuzzi](http://www.tpi.uni-jena.de/~bernuzzi/). 

My research interests include but are not limited to: Gravitational Waves, Compact Binaries and Numerical Relativity.

### Working on
- [TEOBResumS](https://bitbucket.org/eob_ihes/teobresums/src/master/): waveform model framework based on the EOB formalism.
- [CoRe Database](https://core-gitlfs.tpi.uni-jena.de/): open data of binary neutron star waveforms.
- [WATPy](https://git.tpi.uni-jena.de/core/watpy): waveform analysis tools in python.
- [BAM](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.77.024027): evolution code for numerical relativity.
- [Elliptica](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.105.104027): pseudo-spectral code for initial data construction.

### Part of
- [TPI - GW group](https://www.physik.uni-jena.de/en/institutes/institute-for-theoretical-physics/gravitational-waves)
- [CoRe](http://www.computational-relativity.org/)
- [Einstein Telescope Collaboration](http://www.et-gw.eu/)
