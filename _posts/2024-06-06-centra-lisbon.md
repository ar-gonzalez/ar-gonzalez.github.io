My next invited talk this year took place in the Center for Astrophysics and Gravitation (CENTRA) at the Instituto Superior Técnico in Lisbon, Portugal. 
My talk was based on my recent publication, [Numerical-relativity-informed effective-one-body model for black-hole–neutron-star mergers with higher modes and spin precession](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.107.084026) from one of my previous posts. 
For more information about my talk you can visit the official website of the [CENTRA](https://centra.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/events/?id=1169).
