This month I was very honored to be invited to two seminar talks in the UK. The first one being in the University of Southampton, where I gave a talk as part of their
[Gravity Seminar](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/stag/news/seminars/2024/02/8-gravity.page) series.
My talk was based on my recent publication, [Second release of the CoRe database of binary neutron star merger waveforms](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6382/acc231) from one of my previous posts. I mainly focused on waveform accuracy in numerical relativity (NR) simulations and reviewed techniques to ensure that our NR waveforms are actually accurate enough for parameter estimation or waveform modelling purposes.
