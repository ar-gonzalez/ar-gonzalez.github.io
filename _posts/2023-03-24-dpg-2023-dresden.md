I was finally able to attend the annual DPG meeting in person after last year's online modality due to the pandemic. This year it was in the beautiful city of Dresden.
The talk I presented during this meeting was on my recent publication, [Numerical-relativity-informed effective-one-body model for black-holeâ€“neutron-star mergers with higher modes and spin precession](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.107.084026).
