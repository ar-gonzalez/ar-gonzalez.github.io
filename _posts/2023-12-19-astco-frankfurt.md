Before the holidays, I had the opportunity to give a talk for the [AstroCoffee Seminar](https://astro.uni-frankfurt.de/astrocoffee/) series in Frankfurt. In this [talk](https://cloud.itp.uni-frankfurt.de/s/gRBLK4kwpSsjwXQ), I presented the black-hole--neutron star ringdown waveform model from my latest publication [Phys. Rev. D 107, 084026](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.107.084026). During my visit, I had the chance to have interesting discussions with the group in addition to possible collaborations using the `TEOBResumS` model.
