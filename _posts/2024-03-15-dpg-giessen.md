This spring I attended annual DPG meeting in the city of Giessen, Germany. The talk I presented during this meeting was on my recent publication, [Numerical-relativity-informed effective-one-body model for black-holeâ€“neutron-star mergers with higher modes and spin precession](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.107.084026).
