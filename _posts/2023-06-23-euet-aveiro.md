This week I was very happy to attend the [European Einstein Toolkit Meeting 2023 in Aveiro, Portugal](https://euet2023.web.ua.pt/) as an invited speaker. 
My talk was based on my recent publication, [Second release of the CoRe database of binary neutron star merger waveforms](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6382/acc231) from one of my previous posts. 
You can find the slides of the presentation [here](https://euet2023.web.ua.pt/programme.html#tuesday).

In my talk I also offered a hands on tutorial on how to use [watpy](https://git.tpi.uni-jena.de/core/watpy) to retrieve and analyse the data from the CoRe database. This one can be found under the `/tutorials` folder of watpy.
