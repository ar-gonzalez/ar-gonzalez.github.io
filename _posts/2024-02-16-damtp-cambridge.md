My second invited talk this month took place in the Center of Mathematical Sciences at the University of Cambridge. 
My talk was based on my recent publication, [Numerical-relativity-informed effective-one-body model for black-holeâ€“neutron-star mergers with higher modes and spin precession](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.107.084026) from one of my previous posts. 
For more information about my talk you can visit the official website of the [Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics (DAMTP)](http://talks.cam.ac.uk/talk/index/212317) at Cambridge.
