This summer I was very grateful to have the opportunity of being invited as a lecturer at the ECT* DTP/TALENT 2024 PhD School in Nuclear Theory for Astrophysics in Trento, Italy.
My lecture was based on my recent publication, [Second release of the CoRe database of binary neutron star merger waveforms](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6382/acc231) from one of my previous posts. I mainly focused on gravitational waves theory and reviewed techniques to ensure that our NR waveforms are actually accurate enough for parameter estimation or waveform modelling purposes. 

In addition to my lecture I lead a tutorial where the students were able to learn how to extract and use the information from the database.
More information about the school can be found in the official website of the [ECT* DTP/Talent](https://www.ectstar.eu/trainings/dtp-talent-2024-nuclear-theory-for-astrophysics/).
